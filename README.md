<h1> 📌 Overview </h1>

This repository is accompanied by a complete Time Series Analysis lecture series delivered in 2017, covering both theoretical foundations and applied methods (with R).

The series is designed for students and practitioners whose first language is Arabic and who are interested in:

Undergraduate students in Statistics, Actuarial Science, Economics, or Data Science

Graduate students in Quantitative Fields

Researchers and practitioners interested in forecasting

Anyone seeking a rigorous foundation in time series analysis

It provides a rigorous yet intuitive introduction to classical time series modeling and forecasting.
